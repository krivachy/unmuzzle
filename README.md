# unmuzzle

Do you like [Muzzle](https://muzzleapp.com/)'s notifications but wished you had such an exciting life? Well now you can!

### Quickstart

Just use me:

```
brew install terminal-notifier
git clone git@github.com:krivachy/unmuzzle.git
cd unmuzzle
node unmuzzle.js
```

### Requirements

* Some version of node. I used v7.7.1
* Brew or if not [install terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier#download)

### Options

You can specify the interval which the notifications should come, e.g.:

```
node unmuzzle.js 3000
```

### Known issues

* The terminal icon from terminal-notifier is always visible. Don't think this can be remove. Please submit PR if you know otherwise.
* Some notifications don't work and get displayed.
* Actions don't work
